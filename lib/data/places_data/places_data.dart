Ancient Egyptian sphinxes represented the king with the body of a lion, in a clear demonstration of his power. The evidence points to the Great Sphinx having been carved during the reign of Khafre (Khefren to the ancient Greeks; c. 2558–2532 BC), the builder of the second of the Giza pyramids.'''),

The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.
The site is at the edge of the Western Desert, approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 km (8.1 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. It forms the northernmost part of the 16,000 ha (160 km2; 62 sq mi) Pyramid Fields of the Memphis and its Necropolis UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1979.[1] The pyramid fields include the Abusir, Saqqara, and Dahshur pyramid complexes, which were all built in the vicinity of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis.[1] Further Old Kingdom pyramid fields were located at the sites Abu Rawash, Zawyet El Aryan, and Meidum.'''),

The Grand Egyptian Museum, also known as the Giza Museum, is an archaeological museum under construction in Giza, Egypt, about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Giza pyramid complex. The Museum will host over 100,000 artifacts from ancient Egyptian civilization, including the complete Tutankhamun collection, and many pieces will be displayed for the first time.[4] With 81,000 m2 (872,000 sq ft) of floor space, it will be the world's largest archeological museum.[5] It is being built as part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau, known as "Giza 2030".

Horemheb (c. 1323–1295 BC) was the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Before ascending to the throne, he was an army commander under Tutankhamun (c. 1336–1327 BC), and held other titles such as “Vice-King of the Whole Earth”. He was eventually buried in the Valley of the Kings, as befitted his royal status. Before that, however, Horemheb had built another tomb at Saqqara. This tomb is the largest in the New Kingdom necropolis south of the causeway of King Unas (c. 2375–2345 BC). Like the other major tombs in this necropolis, the tomb’s design is in the style of a temple-tomb, in imitation of the Great Kingdom temples of its time. The tomb begins with a pylon preceding two open courtyards followed by the inner chambers of the shrine, where ritual offerings to Horemheb were performed. The central chamber was surmounted by a pyramid, a solar symbol of resurrection and rebirth. The underground burial chamber was accessed through a vertical shaft cut through the floor of the inner courtyard. The remains of a fetus and the skeleton of a female, possibly Horemheb's wife Mutnedjmet, were discovered in his tomb in the Memphis necropolis, indicating that it was not used.
The reliefs that decorate this tomb include scenes depicting Horemheb in action, showing a group of representatives of foreign rulers pleading before Tutankhamun, while Horemheb acts as an intermediary. Two scenes that indicate his high status even before his accession to the throne show him followed by rows of foreign captives receiving his reward of courage gold from Tutankhamun himself, the courage gold being given by kings to their officials for exceptional services. The tomb is also decorated with funerary scenes, including the opening of the mouth ritual.
The location of this tomb was unknown, having been discovered in the early 19th century as part of a cemetery find by tomb robbers and antique dealers who stole and sold their finds to museums and collectors abroad. Not only were statues and other movable objects stolen, but entire sections of tomb walls were removed and none of this was recorded. The tomb of Horemheb was particularly affected, as its location had disappeared. Fortunately, it was rediscovered in the New Kingdom cemetery in 1975.

Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel, Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. It is located on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. Their huge external rock relief figures of Ramesses II have become iconic. His wife, Nefertari, and children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet. Sculptures inside the Great Temple commemorate Ramesses II's heroic leadership at the Battle of Kadesh.'''),
